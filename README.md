### Introduction:-
<p> When playing Baloot, you have to calculate the points over a long period and manually on paper. This problem can be solved by creating a simple program in the Python language, which facilitates the process, saving time and effort, and making the point calculation easier and more accurate. It can also improve the speed of the game and add more enjoyment.</p>

<p> We have chosen the Python language as our preferred programming language. Python is a high-level, open-source language known for its simplicity, easy readability, and emphasis on understandability and quick development. Python was designed to be a powerful and flexible language used in a wide range of applications in our daily lives. </p>

<p> In our implementation, we utilized various features of Python to achieve our goals. We used the "def" function to define the value of the cards and recall the defined function using the "return" statement, making the process simple, easy, and fast. We also utilized the "class" function to organize card points in a set of ordered tables. Additionally, we employed a " dictionary‚Äù to store and define values in our "Msharie". We made use of conditional statements (if, elif, else) to differentiate between "san" and "hokm", considering factors such as points and playing type, and determining the winner based on the number of points. </p>

<p> Furthermore, we utilized " Loob" functions to calculate the points for all rounds. We also incorporated mathematical functions such as "ceil(n)", "floor() ", "round()", addition (+), division (\) (%), and comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=). </p>

<p> Finally, we utilized Matplotlib for visualization purposes or any relevant graphical representations. </p>
